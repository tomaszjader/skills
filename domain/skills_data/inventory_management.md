# Inventory Management Schema

## Tables
### products
- product_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- product_name
- sku
- category
- unit_cost
- reorder_point (minimum stock level before reordering)
- discontinued (boolean)

### warehouses
- warehouse_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- warehouse_name
- location
- capacity

### inventory
- inventory_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- product_id (FOREIGN KEY -> products)
- warehouse_id (FOREIGN KEY -> warehouses)
- quantity_on_hand
- last_updated

### stock_movements
- movement_id (PRIMARY KEY)
- product_id (FOREIGN KEY -> products)
- warehouse_id (FOREIGN KEY -> warehouses)
- movement_type (inbound/outbound/transfer/adjustment)
- quantity (positive for inbound, negative for outbound)
- movement_date
- reference_number

## Business Logic
**Available stock**: quantity_on_hand from inventory table where quantity_on_hand > 0
**Products needing reorder**: Products where total quantity_on_hand across all warehouses is less than or equal to the product's reorder_point
**Active products only**: Exclude products where discontinued = true unless specifically analyzing discontinued items
**Stock valuation**: quantity_on_hand * unit_cost for each product

## Example Query
-- Find products below reorder point across all warehouses
SELECT p.product_id, p.product_name, p.reorder_point, SUM(i.quantity_on_hand) as total_stock, p.unit_cost, (p.reorder_point - SUM(i.quantity_on_hand)) as units_to_reorder
FROM products p
JOIN inventory i ON p.product_id = i.product_id
WHERE p.discontinued = false
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name, p.reorder_point, p.unit_cost
HAVING SUM(i.quantity_on_hand) <= p.reorder_point
ORDER BY units_to_reorder DESC;
